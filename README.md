### Fatuito is an iOs mobile game developed with the SpriteKit framework. The game is set in a gloomy, atmospheric yet colorful world called Laetasia that adds a unique twist to the gameplay.

Players control a character that rolls and jumps through levels filled with obstacles and enemies, with gyroscope controls.

It is localised both in Italian and English, and has the accessibility option to switch between gyroscope or touch controls.
