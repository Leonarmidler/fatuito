### Fatuito is an iOs mobile game developed with the SpriteKit framework. The game is set in a gloomy, atmospheric yet colorful world called Laetasia that adds a unique twist to the gameplay.

Players control a character that rolls and jumps through levels filled with obstacles and enemies, with gyroscope controls.

It is localised both in Italian and English, and has the accessibility option to switch between gyroscope or touch controls.

### Devs notes:
We are very happy to present our project! The game was developed in a little less than a month as a learning project, with a framework the coders were still beginners at. It was in fact a **huge** learning experience for all of us, of which we're extremely proud and we hope to keep working at it as a team, with the goal to publish it on the App Store. Feel free to try out the demo on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/eNVwAIvT) and give us [feedback](crisantemi.dev@proton.me)!
